**Git & GitHub** 🌳🔗

---

### 1. What is Git and GitHub?

- **Git:** A distributed version control system; tracks changes in files & folders.
    
- **GitHub:** Cloud platform hosting Git repositories; enables collaboration, code review, and project management.
    

> _Analogy:_ Git is like your local diary where you note changes; GitHub is the public library where you share your diary and collaborate with others.

### 2. Git Concepts & Commands

#### 2.1 Repository (Repo)

- Folder containing project files and Git history.
    
- **Init:** `git init` creates a new local repo.
    
- **Clone:** `git clone <url>` copies remote repo locally.
    

#### 2.2 Staging & Commits

- **Working Directory:** Your current files.
    
- **Staging Area:** Files marked for next commit.
    
- **Commit:** Snapshot of staged changes.
    

```bash
git status               # show changed files
git add file.js          # stage one file
git add .                # stage all changes
git commit -m "Message"  # create a commit
```

> _Tip:_ Write clear commit messages like “Fix login bug” or “Add user profile component.”

#### 2.3 Branches

- **Branch:** Parallel version of code.
    
- **Main branch:** Often called `main` or `master`.
    

```bash
git branch               # list branches
git branch feature-1     # create branch
git checkout feature-1   # switch branch
git checkout main        # back to main
git merge feature-1      # merge feature into main
git branch -d feature-1  # delete branch
git checkout -b hotfix   # create+switch
```

> _Analogy:_ Branches are like separate roads; you can explore without disturbing the main highway.

### 3. Merging & Conflicts

- **Fast-forward merge:** When main has no new commits, branch just moves pointer.
    
- **Three-way merge:** Combines divergent changes; may cause conflicts.
    

```bash
git merge feature-1
```

- **Conflict:** Git flags files; open, edit to resolve, then:
    

```bash
git add resolved-file  
git commit # finishes merge commit

```

> *Tip:* Use `git diff` to inspect changes and help resolve conflicts.

---

### 4. Pushing to GitHub
1. **Add remote:** `git remote add origin <url>`
2. **Push branch:** `git push -u origin feature-1`
3. **Subsequent pushes:** `git push`

> *Note:* `-u` sets upstream so future `git push` knows where to send your commits.

---

### 5. Collaboration on GitHub

#### 5.1 Fork & Pull Request (PR)
- **Fork:** Copy someone else’s repo to your GitHub account.
- **PR:** Request to merge your changes into the original repo.

> *Workflow:* Fork → Clone → Create branch → Commit & push → Open PR → Code review → Merge

#### 5.2 Team Workflow & Best Practices
- **Feature branches:** Each task gets its own branch.
- **Pull requests:** Describe changes clearly; request reviews.
- **Code reviews:** Teammates comment on PR; ensure quality.
- **Merge strategies:** Squash, rebase, or merge commits—agree on a team policy.

> *Analogy:* Team coding is like writing a book together; branches are chapters, PRs are editor reviews, and merges publish the final draft.

*Now you’re set to version-control your projects and collaborate like a pro!* 🚀
